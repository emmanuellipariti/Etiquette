Etiquette is an iOS app developed in Swift on Xcode, designed to simplify garment care by reading washing symbols and providing tips for stubborn stain removal. The app allows users to scan clothing labels, edit and save the scanned items for future reference, and also offers natural stain-removal suggestions based on fabric types. The goal of the app is to help users preserve their clothes and take better care of them in an easy and intuitive way.

Etiquette is designed to simplify garment care and help users keep their clothes in good condition. The app allows users to:
- Scan washing symbols on clothing labels.
- Edit and save scanned items for future reference.
- Get suggestions for removing stubborn stains, categorized by stain type and fabric.

The project is not yet complete: saving data is currently missing but is planned as one of the next development steps to make the app fully functional.

## Features

- **Washing symbol scanning**: Utilizes a machine learning model to read washing symbols on clothing labels.
- **Stain removal section**: Suggestions for removing stubborn stains with natural methods or "grandma's remedies," categorized by stain type and fabric.
- **Item archive**: Ability to edit and save scanned clothing items for future reference.

### Future updates:
- Implementation of data-saving functionality to maintain a complete archive of scanned clothing items and treated stains.


## Usage

Once the app is installed and running, you can use it as follows:

1. **Scan the label**: Use the camera to scan the washing symbols on your garments.
2. **Edit and save**: Edit the scanned clothing item details and save them for future reference.
3. **Consult stain removal tips**: Go to the "Stain Removal" section to find natural remedies for stains based on fabric type.

## Technologies
